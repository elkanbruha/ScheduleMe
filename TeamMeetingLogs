Week 1:
Decisions:
- We will build the home page, log-in page, and registration page
- We will create the post and get requests for the log-in and registration in the .js file
- We will create SQL queries
- We will look at expanding the scope of our calandar app to include more advanced features

Alternative Actions/Decisions Discussed:
- In the case that some is struggling to complete their task, we will reassign people from less critical tasks to help them complete the tasks 
that are more critical.
- Elkan, Alex, and Yuxiang will be assigned to primarily front-end development while the rest of the team will be assigned to back-end
development and the creation of documentation. These roles aren't hard rules but rather guilines based on general intrest and skill.

Follow-ups:
- Continue to improve upon the work that we have done while beginning new features and UI upgrades
- Start using branches to develop so that we don't mess up work
